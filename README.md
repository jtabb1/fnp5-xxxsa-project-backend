# Phase 5 Project : An Online To-do App 
#                   that Uses Rails and React

Evolved from my phase 4 project which evolved from the 
Flatiron example : Rails Mock Challenge - Camping Fun.

The part that is hosted and authenticated evolved 
from the Flatiron example : Rails and React Heroku 
Demo App.

This last example was found by my fellow Flatiron 
student Lisa Swart, to whom I am extremely grateful 
for her sharing this with me.
